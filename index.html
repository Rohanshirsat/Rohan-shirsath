                    <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>(14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist,
                    economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting
                    the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and
                    Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit
                    Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.
                    After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics
                    at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923,
                    respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in
                    the 1920s.
                    He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist,
                    professor,
                    and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning
                    and
                    negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for
                    Dalits,
                    and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism,
                    initiating
                    mass conversions of Dalits.
                    In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar.
                    The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by
                    the nickname Babasaheb , meaning "Respected Father".
